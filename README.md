## Introduction

Handwritten digit recognition is a classic problem in the field of computer vision and machine learning. This repository contains the code and resources used to participate in the Kaggle Digit Recognizer competition, where the goal is to correctly identify digits (0-9) from a dataset of handwritten images.

## Competition Overview

- **Host**: Kaggle
- **Objective**: Build a model to accurately recognize handwritten digits.
- **Dataset**: MNIST dataset, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images.
- **Evaluation Metric**: Accuracy of the model on the test set.


## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Digit-Recognizer.git
cd Digit-Recognizer
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Prepare the dataset for training and evaluation.
   ```bash
   python src/data_preprocessing.py
   ```

2. **Train the Model**: Train the digit recognition model on the prepared dataset.
   ```bash
   python src/model_training.py
   ```

3. **Evaluate the Model**: Assess the performance of the trained model.
   ```bash
   python src/model_evaluation.py
   ```

## Results

Our model achieved an impressive accuracy of **XX.XX%** on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in recognizing handwritten digits. Detailed results and analysis can be found in the `Model_Evaluation.ipynb` notebook.
